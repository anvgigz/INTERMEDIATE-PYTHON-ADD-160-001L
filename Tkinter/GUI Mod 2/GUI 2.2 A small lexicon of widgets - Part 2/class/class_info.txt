Objectives:
At the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

Understand and use Label widgets with both static text and text variables.
Understand and use Message widgets.
Understand and use Frame widgets and organize other widgets within them.

Understand and use Entry widgets to get user input.

In this lesson, we will continue exploring some of the non-clickable widgets available in Python's Tkinter library. By the end of this lesson, students will be able to create interfaces using labels, messages, frames, label frames, and entry widgets.

 

Label Widget
The Label widget displays text or images on the screen. It can display static text or dynamic text using a textvariable.

# Import necessary modules
import tkinter as tk

# Create the main application window
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Label Widget Example")

# Create a static text label
static_label = tk.Label(root, text="This is a static text label.")
static_label.pack()

# Create a dynamic text label using a textvariable
dynamic_text = tk.StringVar()
dynamic_text.set("This is a dynamic text label.")
dynamic_label = tk.Label(root, textvariable=dynamic_text)
dynamic_label.pack()

# Run the application
root.mainloop()
Message Widget
The Message widget is similar to the Label widget but is designed to display multi-line text.

# Create a message widget
message = tk.Message(root, text="This is a message widget, useful for displaying multi-line text.")
message.pack()

# Run the application
root.mainloop()
Frame Widget
The Frame widget is used as a container to organize other widgets. You can add multiple widgets to a frame to group them together.

# Create a frame to hold widgets
frame = tk.Frame(root, bd=2, relief=tk.SUNKEN)
frame.pack(padx=10, pady=10)

# Add labels to the frame
label1 = tk.Label(frame, text="Label inside frame - 1")
label1.pack()

label2 = tk.Label(frame, text="Label inside frame - 2")
label2.pack()

# Run the application
root.mainloop()
LabelFrame Widget
The LabelFrame widget is similar to the Frame widget but includes a title.

# Create a labelframe to hold widgets
labelframe = tk.LabelFrame(root, text="This is a LabelFrame", padx=10, pady=10)
labelframe.pack(padx=10, pady=10)

# Add a label to the labelframe
label_in_labelframe = tk.Label(labelframe, text="Label inside LabelFrame")
label_in_labelframe.pack()

# Run the application
root.mainloop()
Entry Widget
The Entry widget is used to accept a single line of text input from the user.

# Create an entry widget for user input
entry = tk.Entry(root)
entry.pack()

# Create a button to fetch the entry data and display it in a label
def show_entry_data():
    entry_data = entry.get()
    dynamic_text.set(entry_data)

button = tk.Button(root, text="Show Entry Data", command=show_entry_data)
button.pack()

# Run the application
root.mainloop()
 

Assignment: Create an interface
Directions:
Create an interface demonstrating the use of all the widgets covered in this lesson: Label, Message, Frame, LabelFrame, and Entry. Additionally, include a Button that retrieves the text from the Entry widget and displays it in a Label using a textvariable.
The estimated time to complete this assignment is approximately 1-2 hours. Upload the finished assignment to your course directory on GitHub and submit the link.

 

How work will be evaluated:


 

 

Can this assignment be retaken or fixed after the initial submission? Yes, students can submit up to two times.
What will students hand in: A link to the code on GitHub
Feedback: Students will receive feedback on their submissions to help them understand any mistakes in the gradebook.
